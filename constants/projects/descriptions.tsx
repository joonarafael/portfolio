export const EXPLOTRACK_DESCRIPTION = () => {

		<div>
			<p>
				Fullstack application built with the Next.js framework and utilizing the
				React library. The application is hosted on Vercel and uses a Postgres
				database. The application is a tracking tool for a company that keeps
				track of company orders and the flow of explosive products. The
				application includes user authentication, extensive logging, and
				advanced middleware.
				<br />
				<br />
				With this project, I&apos;ve really tried to understand various security
				aspects of web development, and I&apos;ve learned a lot about fullstack
				development. How to handle a production database, how to manage sessions
				client-side but also validate on server-side, how to validate user
				inputs, email verifications, etc.

export const SPOTISAVER_DESCRIPTION = () => {
	return (
		<div>
			<p>
				A useful and simple service that allows users to analyze and export
				their Spotify playlists. The service is built with Next.js and React,
				and is hosted on Vercel. The service is built with a focus on user
				experience and simplicity.
				<br />
				<br />
				The data is fetched and parsed from JSON responses provided by the
				official Spotify API, and finally analyzed through my custom analyzing
				logic. This project was also the first time I implemented a rate limiter
				and understood the importance of securing your API routes.

export const VISUALPATHFINDER_DESCRIPTION = () => {
	return (
		<div>
			<p>
				Fun pathfinder application built as an university assignment. The
				application is built with React and Next.js, and is hosted on Railway.
				The application allows users to compare three different pathfinding
				algorithms: Dijkstra&apos;s, A* and Jump Point Search.
				<br />
				<br />
				Building the algorithms with TypeScript was maybe not the most optimal
				choice, but I wanted to make a really great UI for the application, and
				involving multiple languages would have made the project unnecessary
				complex as a university assignment. I learned a ton of the Jest library
				during the development of this project.

export const TIIRASCRAPER_DESCRIPTION = () => {
	return (
		<div>
			<p>
				Simple web scraper built with Python to scrape bird observations from
				the Finnish bird observation service Tiira.fi. The scraper is built with
				the BeautifulSoup library and the requests library.
				<br />
				<br />
				The scraper has built-in filtering functionality, which enables the user
				to create their own configuration files to allow/block certain species
				and/or cities. On top of all of that, the scraper has a built-in
				Telegram messaging system, which can be configured to send user updates
				when new observations matching the predetermined criteria are found.

export const BLASTCALC_DESCRIPTION = () => {

		<div>
			<p>
				Highly sophisticated calculator tool built with React and Next.js. The
				application is hosted on Cloudflare Pages. The application is a tool for
				mining engineers to create blasting circuit diagrams and calculate
				detonation delays. The application has a modern and responsive UI built
				with the Radix UI library.
				<br />
				<br />
				The application has been built based on a real client request (initial
				software requirements specification). The application involves many
				useful user tools, multiple layers of different analyzing calculations,
				and pathfinding algorithms to create accurate and safe blasting circuit
				diagrams.

export const FLAGGAME_DESCRIPTION = () => {
	return (
		<div>
			<p>
				A completed Python desktop application built as an university
				assignment. The flag game is a local single-player game where the user
				has to guess the country of a flag. The game is built with Python and
				the Tkinter library.
				<br />
				<br />
				The game has five different game modes included, each with different
				pointing mechanisms, and a user-friendly UI. As an addition, the game
				tracks game history and calculates the user&apos;s lifelong statistics!
				During the development of this project, I learned a lot about the Python
				programming language in general, and especially I finally understood the
				importance of unit testing.
