# PORTFOLIO

My personal portfolio website. Check the live website [here](https://joonakettunen.netlify.app "Portfolio Joona Kettunen") hosted by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/ "Netlify - Connect everything. Build anything.").

## General

Runs on a _Next.js_ server. Utilizing the _React_ library. Pre-built UI components by the [shadcn/ui library](https://ui.shadcn.com/ "shadcn/ui - Build your component library").

This was heavily inspired by [this portfolio example](https://www.behance.net/gallery/184320555/Frontend-Web-Developer-UXUI-Designer-Portfolio "Frontend Web Developer | UX/UI Designer Portfolio by Ryan Ramazan"). So feel free to get inspired by my adaptation and reuse any ideas and components in your own developments!
